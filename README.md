# stanford_sql_practice

<strong>Structured Query Language (SQL)</strong> practice code based on Stanford Lagunita Online's SQL course taught by Prof. Jennifer Widom. The course can be accessed <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/info">here.</a>

As per usual, I added some comments during my practice sessions which could be of particular benefit to relatively new SQL coders. The schema has been provided separately from the querying implementation code. 

Topics covered include:

1. Basic SELECT statement</br>
2. Table Variables and Set Operators</br>
3. Subqueries in WHERE clause</br>
4. Subqueries in FROM and SELECT</br>
5. The JOIN family of operators</br>
6. Aggregation</br>
7. Null values</br>
8. Data modification statements</br>

# How to run

As a side note, I created and ran the queries in PostgreSQL so the constructs conform to that database. However, any other relational database engine such as SQLite3 will run 99% of the queries without a problem. Downloading any of these for SQL coding practice is highly recommended.
